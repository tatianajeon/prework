            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>Hi everyone, my name is Tatiana and this is my first html project with Coding Temple! 
                Joining a coding bootcamp is just about the biggest plot twist of my life so far. 
                Looking back, I can identify the times when I was interested in code, such as during the y2k blogging era (xanga, myspace, Wordpress, etc); 
                however, I never thought to make it a career. After some years in the field of dietetics, 
                I find myself wanting to challenge my brain in a different way. My husband kept joking about how he should have gone into coding instead of medicine, and something internalized for me. 
                After talking to a handful of people (friends who code, women who code), I decided to go for it. 
                Though I have a few ideas at the moment, I’m not 100% sure what my career would look like at this point; 
                however, as I learn more I’m gaining more ideas. Not going to lie, sometimes I’m a little nervous because the switch feels so left field: 
                usually RDs go on to start their own private practice or study to become PAs (physician’s assistants), but I don’t know anyone who’s gone into coding. 
                These are the times I just tell myself that I can do it. I’m excited to learn and to get to know my instructors and cohort.

            <h2>RD life</h2>
            <p>I’ve worked in various settings in the field of Dietetics. I served as an inpatient RD in the hospital setting covering a variety of unites such as: 
                med-surge, labor and delivery, cardiac, neurological, medical, and surgical ICUs, transplant, and physical rehabilitation. 
                I’ve worked with inpatient psych/mental health facilities (both private and state institutions), and with outpatient settings such as cardiac rehab, oncology, 
                eating disorders partial hospitalization programs, depression/anxiety/chemical dependency programs, long term care, and adult daycare/geriatric care.
            </p>

            <p>My philosophy on nutrition is that it is something that should be intuitive; however, there are a lot of factors that might offset the intuition: 
                mood, emotions, body image, bad experiences we’ve had around food, just to name a few. Good nutrition is being aware of your needs through education, 
                and being aware of your hunger cues and emotions related to eating. A healthy relationship and understanding of food can help with creating balance in nutritional intake. 
            </p>
            <p> From the many people I’ve met, it’s clear that nutrition has become very confusing to many. One of my ideas is to create a way to counsel clients on nutrition, 
                and then set up or create a personalized app function for the client to use (and for RDs to use to serve clients) to become more independent in their 
                journey for balanced nutrition.

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>In the off hours, I enjoy being outside. When the weather is right, you can find me biking, walking or hiking with friends, rock climbing, playing tennis, and more recently, longboarding. 
                I’ve also grown up playing on the golf; however, because of the stressful and competitive nature of playing on a varsity team, I’ve sort of avoided playing it for now. 
                My husband and I spent our first year of marriage learning to surf. There’s nothing like the feeling of catching a wave against the background of the sunset and green Hawaiian mountain while whale watching, 
                or sitting on your board while pelicans dive straight into the ocean to catch fish off the California coast. While our love for surfing doesn’t equate to how good we are, it’s really what we miss the most leaving HI and CA. 
                We bought wetsuits on our move out of CA in hopes that we’ll be visiting often to surf with our friends out there. 
                     </p>

            <p>When indoors, my husband and I love to host guests. We really enjoy making dinner for our friends and playing board games or just talking for hours. 
                It’s one of our greater joys to see others comfortably enjoying their time at our place. </p>
            <p>Also, I don't have a dog of my own; however, I love dogs and love playing with other people's dogs. </p>
